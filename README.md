# Now read the real time data's using the RS485 Sensor and CoolTerm Software Serial

**Step 1: Downloading CoolTerm**

* **Action:** You've correctly identified that CoolTerm is a terminal application used for serial communication.
* **Download Source:** You've pointed to a link (not provided here, but presumably a reputable source) for downloading the ZIP file.
* **Installation:** You've noted that CoolTerm is portable, meaning it doesn't require a formal installation. You can run the executable (EXE) file directly. This is a significant advantage for quick setup and troubleshooting.

**Step 2: Connecting the NPK Sensor**

* **Hardware:** You're using an NPK sensor (a device that measures Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium levels) and an NPK USB converter.
* **Purpose of Converter:** The USB converter likely translates the sensor's serial communication protocol (e.g., UART, RS-232) into a USB connection that your computer can recognize.
* **Importance of Connection:** Establishing a proper physical connection is crucial for data transfer between the sensor and your computer.

**Key Considerations and Next Steps**

1.  **Driver Installation:**
    * The NPK USB converter may require driver installation for your computer to recognize it. Check the converter's documentation or the manufacturer's website for driver downloads.
    * Without the correct drivers, the converter won't create a virtual COM port, and CoolTerm won't be able to communicate with the sensor.

2.  **Identifying the COM Port:**
    * Once the drivers are installed, you need to identify the COM port assigned to the NPK USB converter.
    * **Windows:** You can find this in the Device Manager (search for "Device Manager" in the Windows search bar). Look under "Ports (COM & LPT)."
    * **Mac/Linux:** The device will have a dev/tty type name.

3.  **CoolTerm Configuration:**
    * After identifying the COM port, you'll need to configure CoolTerm:
        * **Serial Port:** Select the correct COM port.
        * **Baud Rate:** This is the communication speed. You'll need to find the baud rate specified in the NPK sensor's documentation. Common baud rates include 9600, 115200, etc.
        * **Data Bits, Parity, Stop Bits:** These settings also need to match the sensor's specifications.

4.  **NPK Sensor Documentation:**
    * The most critical resource is the NPK sensor's documentation. It will provide:
        * Connection diagrams.
        * Communication protocol details (baud rate, data bits, etc.).
        * Data format (how the sensor sends the NPK values).
        * Commands to send to the sensor, if any.

5.  **Power Supply:**
    * Ensure the NPK sensor is receiving adequate power. Many sensors are powered via the USB connection, but some require an external power supply.

6.  **Data Interpretation:**
    * Once you receive data in CoolTerm, you'll need to understand its format. The sensor's documentation will explain how to interpret the raw data to obtain the NPK values.

7. **Connect and Send Hex String:**
   * Open the serial software and click **connect**. When the sensor is properly connect with the serial communiaction software then click **connection + send string**.
     We need to send HEX string not plan text. So, to verify the address of Moisture, Temperatue, EC, pH and CRC write the string- **01 03 00 00 00 04 44 09** and click **send** button.
     By clicking send button the software will show us a 13 bit of address.
